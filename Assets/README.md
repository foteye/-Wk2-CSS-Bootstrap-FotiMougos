Homework Week 2 - Responsive Portfolio<br>
Author: Foti Mougos<br>

### Brief:
We have been asked to publish a portfolio with an Introduction of who we are, a portfolio of hobbies and interests and a contact page. The page should be responsive in all resolutions and include a navbar that can be used to navigate the different pages.

### Lessons Learned:
Pretty much everything has been done before in bootstrap. There's always some bootstrap class I can use and some of my own CSS to tweak things to my liking. The bootstrap column system is awesome, but not exactly necessary in all cases. I couldn't think of a good reason to put it in to the index.html or contact.html pages. The bootstrap form classes helped heaps in formatting the contact page and adding placeholder/form text. The navbar can "collapse" in certain resolutions to fit the screen but because we had so few things on the navbar I opted to not let it collapse. The footer was also done with some bootstrap classes.
